## 3.2 Evolution of Sentiment Analysis Approaches

### 3.2.1 Traditional Lexicon-based Methods
The field of sentiment analysis has undergone significant transformation in recent years, evolving from simple lexicon-based approaches to sophisticated deep learning architectures. Traditional sentiment analysis approaches relied primarily on lexicon-based methods, where words were assigned predefined sentiment scores. Liu (2015) in his seminal work "Sentiment Analysis: Mining Opinions, Sentiments, and Emotions" established the theoretical foundations for these approaches, highlighting their simplicity but also their limitations in handling contextual nuances and linguistic complexities such as negation, sarcasm, and domain-specific terminology. These early systems, while interpretable, frequently misclassified complex emotional expressions and struggled with implicit sentiment.

### 3.2.2 Machine Learning Approaches
Machine learning algorithms subsequently improved sentiment analysis performance through supervised learning techniques. Pang and Lee (2008) demonstrated that support vector machines (SVMs) and Naive Bayes classifiers could achieve accuracy rates of 75-85% on benchmark datasets, representing a significant improvement over lexicon-based methods. Their work pioneered feature engineering approaches that captured syntactic patterns and contextual indicators, establishing a methodological framework that informed subsequent research. Despite these advances, these approaches still required extensive manual feature engineering and struggled with the inherent complexity of natural language.

### 3.2.3 Transformer-based Models
The revolutionary advancement came with the introduction of deep learning approaches, particularly transformer-based models. Devlin et al. (2019) introduced BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers), which fundamentally changed the NLP landscape by pre-training deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text. Their research demonstrated that BERT achieved state-of-the-art results across eleven NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis, with minimal task-specific architectural modifications. This breakthrough enabled models to capture complex contextual relationships and linguistic nuances that had previously been beyond the reach of computational approaches, establishing a new paradigm for sentiment analysis research and applications.
